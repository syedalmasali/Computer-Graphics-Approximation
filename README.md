# Computer-Graphics-Approximation


In computer graphics, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is extensively studied for rendering the surface appearance of objects using light and view vectors. However, real-time BRDF computation is challenging due to its complexity and size. To address this, we explored the use of rational functions to approximate the model for more efficient representation. Our work focuses on fitting a rational function through quadratic optimization, ensuring a pole-free design to prevent asymptotic behavior, determining the appropriate degree size, and constructing a stable set of polynomial bases.
